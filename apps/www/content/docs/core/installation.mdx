## Install

```bash
pnpm add @gobrand/calendar-core
# or
npm install @gobrand/calendar-core
```

## TypeScript

The package is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions. No additional `@types` packages needed.

## Temporal Polyfill

The Temporal API is included via `@js-temporal/polyfill`. You can import Temporal types directly from the polyfill:

```typescript
import { Temporal } from '@js-temporal/polyfill';

const today = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO();
const meeting = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2025-01-20T14:00:00-05:00[America/New_York]');
```
